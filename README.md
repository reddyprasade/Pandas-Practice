# What is Pandas?
***
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as
    `NaN`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and
    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional
    objects
  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can
    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically
    align the data for you in computations
  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform
    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating
    and transforming data
  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,
    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures
    into DataFrame objects
  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy
    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of
    large data sets
  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data
    sets
  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of
    data sets
  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple
    labels per tick)
  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]
    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],
    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]
  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range
    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,
    date shifting and lagging.
